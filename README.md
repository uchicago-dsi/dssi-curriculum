# DSSI (Data Science for Social Impact) Curriculum

This repository contains the materials used to teach students during the first few weeks of the DSSI Summer program. There are directories containing materials from each year the program has run. Each directory contains ipynb and data files for the content taught that year as well as a README.md file describing the order in which is was taught and how long each module lasted. Content was presented using Jupyter Slides which students could open on their own machines as Jupyter Notebooks. The curriculum contains a mixture of lectures, labs, activities, and homework assignments.

Authors of these files include:
* Amanda Jotte
* Susanna Lange
* Bill Trok
* Satadisha Saha Bhowmick
* Evelyn Campbell

We encourage the editing and use of these materials with proper attribution to the original author(s).
